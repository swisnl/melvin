This is a (slightly opinionated) client for the [Melvin](https://melvin.ndw.nu) API by NDW. Please note that the Melvin API requires authentication, and we can't provide you with credentials.

## Install

Via Composer

``` bash
$ composer require swisnl/melvin
```

N.B. Make sure you have installed a PSR-18 HTTP Client and PSR-17 HTTP Factories before you install this package or install one at the same time e.g. `composer require swisnl/json-api-client guzzlehttp/guzzle:^7.3`.

### HTTP Client

We are decoupled from any HTTP messaging client with the help of [PSR-18 HTTP Client](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-18/) and [PSR-17 HTTP Factories](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-17/).
This requires an extra package providing [psr/http-client-implementation](https://packagist.org/providers/psr/http-client-implementation) and [psr/http-factory-implementation](https://packagist.org/providers/psr/http-factory-implementation).
To use Guzzle 7, for example, simply require `guzzlehttp/guzzle`:

``` bash
composer require guzzlehttp/guzzle:^7.3
```

## Usage

``` php
use Swis\Melvin\Client;
use Swis\Melvin\SituationFilterParameters;

$client = Client::create('username', 'password');
$params = (new SituationFilterParameters())->setAreaIds([409]);

$situations = $client->situations()->export($params);

foreach ($situations as $situation) {
  // Do stuff with the situation
}
```
